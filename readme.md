# Personal Library

cd personal-library
npm install -g
```

## Why Javascript?
It's a little outside my comfort zone and I have a lot to learn, so I used it as a learning opportunity.
If I could redo it, I would try Typescript, because there were some type safety issues there that I could
have gotten around with Typescript. Plus, interfaces.
